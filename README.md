# Addictions Simulation Game

## Description
This project simulates various addictive behaviors, allowing users to make choices related to food, gambling, and gaming. It aims to educate players about the consequences of addictive habits.



Inspired by family and friends affected.
## How it works

The game consists of multiple simulations, each focusing on a different type of addiction. Players can choose from:

* Food Addiction: Make decisions about meals, balancing between healthy and unhealthy options while managing a budget and total calorie intake.

* Gambling Addiction: Guess numbers to win or lose money, learning about the risks associated with gambling.

* Screen Addiction: Choose activities throughout the day, observing how different choices affect dopamine levels and overall lifestyle.

* Substance Addiction: Face a choice between being productive or using substances, and over time, substance use takes a toll on their health.

As players progress, they receive feedback on their choices, encouraging them to reflect on their habits.

## Challenges 
Scope Limitation: Due to time constraints, we focused on a few types of addictions, which may limit the game.

User Engagement: Creating a balance between educational content and engaging gameplay was challenging, as we wanted to maintain interest while giving a important message about the type of addiction.

Topic: Finding a topic that combined innovation, education, and life changing impact was a bit challenging, especially since we were limited to using raw Python. As beginners, we thought the topic we landed on is a good fit, even if it might not be the most advanced option.

## Potential Impact
This project aims to spread awareness about addictive behaviors and their consequences. By simulating real-life scenarios, players can better understand the effects of their choices and the importance of moderation in all aspects of life.
